[Dutch PHP Conference 2014](http://www.phpconference.nl) example code presented during the talk ["Encryption, authentication and data integrity in PHP"](https://joind.in/10877) of Enrico Zimuel.

Requirements
------------

You need PHP >= 5.5 because I used the [hash_pbkdf2](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.hash-pbkdf2.php) function that is available only from 5.5.
